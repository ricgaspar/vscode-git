Microsoft has disabled the ability to run the explorer.exe process as a seperate user. 
Although not officially supported by Microsoft at this date, if you wanted to get around this limitation, modify the following regkey.

- Take ownership of registry key HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\AppID\{CDCBCFCA-3CDC-436f-A4E2-0E02075250C2} 
  Current owner=Trusted Installer but should be Administrators.
- Grant the Administrators or yourself Full Control permissions on that same key.
- Rename the subkey from 'runas' to '_runas'.

Once this is changed you can you launch Explorer with a different set of credentials via the runas command, and possibly with a 3rd party application.
