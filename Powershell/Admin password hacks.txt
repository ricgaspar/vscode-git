Sticky Keys Hack
-------------------------------------------------------------------
To reset a forgotten administrator password, follow these steps:
1.Boot from Windows PE or Windows RE and access the command prompt.
2.Find the drive letter of the partition where Windows is installed. In Vista and Windows XP, it is usually C:, 
  in Windows 7, it is D: in most cases because the first partition contains Startup Repair. 
  To find the drive letter, type C: (or D:, respectively) and search for the Windows folder. 
  Note that Windows PE (RE) usually resides on X:.
3.Type the following command (replace “c:” with the correct drive letter if Windows is not located on C:):
  copy c:\windows\system32\sethc.exe c:\
  This creates a copy of sethc.exe to restore later.
4.Type this command to replace sethc.exe with cmd.exe:
  copy /y c:\windows\system32\cmd.exe c:\windows\system32\sethc.exe
5.Reboot your computer and start the Windows installation where you forgot the administrator password.
6.After you see the logon screen, press the SHIFT key five times.
7.You should see a command prompt where you can enter the following command to reset the Windows password (see screenshot above):
  net user you_user_name new_password. If you don’t know your user name, just type net user to list the available user names.
8.You can now log on with the new password.

Offline Registry Editting
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Windows RE: You only need a Windows 7 or Windows Vista installation DVD. 
After you boot from the DVD, click “Next,” then click “Repair your computer,” 
then click “Next” (Use recovery tools), and then “Command Prompt.”

Use regedit as offline Registry editor
1.Launch regedit on the command prompt.
2.Click HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE.
3.In the File menu, click “Load Hive.”
4.Open the database file that contains the Registry hive you need: 
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \SAM = %windir%\system32\config\SAM
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \SYSTEM = %windir%\system32\config\SYSTEM
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \SOFTWARE = %windir%\system32\config\SOFTWARE
HKEY_USERS \.Default = %windir%\system32\config\DEFAULT
HKEY_CURRENT_USER = %userprofile%\ntuser.dat

5.Enter an arbitrary key name when prompted. A new node with your key name appears under 
6.Edit the Registry entries in the new node
7.Click the root folder of your node, and then click “Unload hive” in the File menu. Your changes will be written to the offline Registry.

Note that you can import and export .reg files to the offline Registry edtior. This allows you to use Registry settings from another machine for troubleshooting purposes.
Also note that this procedure can be used to edit the settings of a user profile without logging on with the corresponding user account. 

To offline enable the built-in administrator account, follow these steps:

1.Load the SAM Registry hive with regedit as described in my post about the offline Registry editor.
2.Navigate to HKLM\%your_key_name%\SAM\Domains\Accounts\Users\Names\.
3.Click “Administrator” and note the value in the column 'type'.
4.Navigate to HKLM\%your_key_name%\SAM\Domains\Accounts\Users\.
5.Use the type value you noted before to locate the Registry key of the administrator account
6.Edit the F entry of the administrator key and navigate to the 0038 position.
7.If the built-in administrator account is disabled, the value of this position is “11?; replace it with “10?. 
NOTE: Make sure to edit the correct position because editing binary values in the Registry is a bit tricky: 
Move the cursor to the beginning of position 0038, press “DEL,” and then type “10?. 
8.Click %your_key_name% and then unload the hive through the corresponding menu point in the File menu.
After you reboot, you can log on using the built-in administrator and reset the password of other accounts.
