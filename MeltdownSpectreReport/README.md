# Properties
## Mitigation Status
This highly relies on the information from [Spectre still unfixed, unlike what Intel says](https://gist.github.com/woachk/2f86755260f2fee1baf71c90cd6533e9) and [CPU security bugs caused by speculative execution](https://github.com/marcan/speculation-bugs/blob/master/README.md). I highly recommend to read them.

*Note: Not every mitigation, especially for CVE-2017-5753 is of the same quality. As the root cause relies in the CPU, all these mitigations are not really a **fix** to the actual problem. Mitigation means, it's "more difficult to exploit", and not every mitigation makes it equally difficult. ;)*

### CVE-2017-5754 mitigated (aka Meltdown)
Is `true` if CVE-2017-5754 mitigated if `KVAShadowRequired` is `false`, or if `KVAShadowWindowsSupportPresent`, `KVAShadowWindowsSupportEnabled`, and `KVAShadowPcidEnabled` are `true`. The test are actually done by [Get-SpeculationControlSettings](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/SpeculationControl/1.0.2/Content/SpeculationControl.psm1)].

### CVE-2017-5715 mitigated (aka Spectre Variant 2)
Is `true` if `BTIHardwarePresent`, `BTIWindowsSupportPresent`, and `BTIWindowsSupportEnabled` are `true`. The test are actually done by [Get-SpeculationControlSettings](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/SpeculationControl/1.0.2/Content/SpeculationControl.psm1)]

### CVE-2017-5753 mitigated in Edge (aka Spectre Variant 1)
Is `true` if one of the following Windows Updates is installed:
'KB4056893', 'KB4056890', 'KB4056891', 'KB4056892', 'KB4056888'

The list of updates was obtained from [ADV180002 | Guidance to mitigate speculative execution side-channel vulnerabilities](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/ADV180002).

Is `empty` if Edge was not found.

### CVE-2017-5753 mitigated in IE (aka Spectre Variant 1)
Is `true` if one of the following Windows Updates is installed:
'KB4056890', 'KB4056895', 'KB4056894', 'KB4056568', 'KB4056893', 'KB4056891', 'KB4056892'

The list of updates was obtained from [ADV180002 | Guidance to mitigate speculative execution side-channel vulnerabilities](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/ADV180002).

Also see [Mitigating speculative execution side-channel attacks in Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer](https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2018/01/03/speculative-execution-mitigations-microsoft-edge-internet-explorer/) for details.

Is `empty` if IE was not found.

### CVE-2017-5753 mitigated in Chrome (aka Spectre Variant 1)
Is `true` if `C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe` is version >=64, or 63 and `Site Isolation` is enabled by policy.

See [Googleâ€™s Mitigations Against CPU Speculative Execution Attack Methods](https://support.google.com/faqs/answer/7622138), [Actions Required to Mitigate Speculative Side-Channel Attack Techniques](https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/ssca) for details.

Read more about [Site Isolation](https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/site-isolation) and enable if desired as follows: 

`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies\Google\Chrome\SitePerProcess` is `1`. 

See also [Policy List/SitePerProcess](https://www.chromium.org/administrators/policy-list-3#SitePerProcess).

Is `empty` if Chrome was not found.

### CVE-2017-5753 mitigated in Firefox (aka Spectre Variant 1)
Is `true` if `C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe` is version >=54.0.7

See [Mitigations landing for new class of timing attack](https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2018/01/03/mitigations-landing-new-class-timing-attack/) for details.

Is `empty` if Firefox was not found.

## isHyperV
Is `true` if `vmms` (Hyper-V Management) Service is running. 

Hypervisors are at increased risk.

## isTerminalServer
Is `true` if `TerminalServerMode` is `1`. 

Terminal Servers (Remote Desktop Servers) are at increased risk.

## isDocker
Is `true` if `PATH` system variable contains `docker` (which is the default). 

Container hoster are at increased risk.

## BTI*
BTI is *Branch Target Injection* as described in [CVE-2017-5715](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-5715) alias [Spectre](https://spectreattack.com/) (Variant 2). 

This vulnerability requires always a microcode update for the CPU, which will be offered by the hardware OEM.

These properties might give you further insights, why `CVE-2017-5715 mitigated` is `false`.

## KVA*
KVA or Kernel VA (also known as KPTI (Kernel page-table isolation) or KAISER) removes the mapping of kernel memory in user space process and thus mitigates the practical explotation of [CVE-2017-5754](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-5754) alias [Meltdown](https://meltdownattack.com/).

`KVAShadowPcidEnabled`, too, needs the microcode CPU update that comes with a BIOS/firmware update by your vendor.

These properties might give you further insights, why `CVE-2017-5754 mitigated` is `false`.

## OSMitigationRegKeySet
As per [Windows Server guidance to protect against speculative execution side-channel vulnerabilities](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4072698
):

> Customers need to enable mitigations to help protect against speculative execution side-channel vulnerabilities.
> 
> Enabling these mitigations may affect performance. The actual performance impact will depend on multiple factors, such as the specific chipset in your physical host and the workloads that are running. Microsoft recommends that customers assess the performance impact for their environment and make necessary adjustments.

`OSMitigationRegKeySet` is `true` if the values for the registry key `Memory Management` are set as required, i.e. `FeatureSettingsOverride` is `0` and `FeatureSettingsOverrideMask` is `3`.

To create the required values, you can use the following PowerShell commands:
```powershell
New-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Memory Management' -PropertyType 'DWORD' -Value '0'  -Name 'FeatureSettingsOverride'
New-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Memory Management' -PropertyType 'DWORD' -Value '3'  -Name 'FeatureSettingsOverrideMask'
```

*Note: This is not required for Clients.*

## AVCompatibility
As per [Important information regarding the Windows security updates released on January 3, 2018 and anti-virus software](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4072699), the security updates are only installed, if the registry value `cadca5fe-87d3-4b96-b7fb-a231484277cc` is present in `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\QualityCompat`. 

The value is either set by the the installed Anti-Virus, or must be set manually if no Anti-Virus is installed.

To add the value manually, you can use the following line of PowerShell:
```powershell
New-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\QualityCompat' -Name 'cadca5fe-87d3-4b96-b7fb-a231484277cc' -PropertyType DWord -Value '0x00000000'
```
*Note: Only use this command, if you don't have any Anti-Virus installed, or verified that it's compatible!*
