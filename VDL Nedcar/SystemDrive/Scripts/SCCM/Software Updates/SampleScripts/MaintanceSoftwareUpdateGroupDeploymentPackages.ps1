# This script is designed to make comparisons between all softwareupdate deployment packages and all
# software update groups.
#
# Each software update deployment package will be scanned against all configured software update
# groups and where an update remains in a given deployment package that is not a part of any
# software update group then that update will be removed from the deployment package.  After
# a given update deployment package completes processing and if there are deletions detected for
# the software update group then the package will be updated to all associated distribution points.
# Note:  It is very easy to reconfigure the script to NOT update the distribution points - see comments 
# in script.
#
# In addition, each software update group will be scanned against all configured software update
# deployment packages.  Where an update is found to exist in an update group but not in a deployment
# package the update will be called out for potential administrative action.
# Note:  This script will not add software updates to a deployment package if they are missing.  That
# action should be handled by an administrator to ensure proper deployment packages are selected for a
# given update or group.  In addition, this script assumes that only software update groups are being
# leveraged for deployment of updates to the environment.  If an update has been deployed individually
# without being included in a software update group then this script will consider such an update as a 
# candidate for deletion fromt the update deployment package.
#
# Note that in ConfigMgr 2012 when an update is removed from a deployment package the source content for
# the update is automatically removed as well so no specific handling to remove source content is used in
# the script.
